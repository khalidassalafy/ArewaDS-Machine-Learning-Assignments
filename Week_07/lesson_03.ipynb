Another approach is to ignore the meaning of the words, and instead use machine learning to detect patterns. This can work in translation if you have lots of text (a corpus) or texts (corpora) in both the origin and target languages.\n",

        "\n",
        "For instance, when an English phrase such as I have no money is translated literally to French, it might become Je n'ai pas de monnaie. \"Monnaie\" is a tricky french 'false cognate', as 'money' and 'monnaie' are not synonymous. A better translation that a human might make would be Je n'ai pas d'argent, because it better conveys the meaning that you have no money (rather than 'loose change' which is the meaning of 'monnaie').\n",

You could test it with some emails that you had not used to train the model, and see if it came to the same conclusion as you did. Then, once you were happy with the accuracy of the model, you could process future emails without having to read each one.\n",
